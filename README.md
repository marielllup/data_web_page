# 📊 Unemployment Index in Italy — Interactive Data Visualization

This project is an interactive web application that visualizes unemployment trends in Italy using official ISTAT data.  
The interface allows users to switch between two perspectives:

- **Unemployment by territory in 2023**  
- **Unemployment trends across years (2013–2023)**

The charts are dynamically styled and presented through a clean user interface to make the information easy to read and compare.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – styling, color palette, spacing  
- **JavaScript** – interactive chart switching, dataset handling  
- **D3.js (exploration)** — During development I explored different D3.js methods for data manipulation and custom chart construction, testing how to structure scales, axes, and data binding for more flexible visualizations.
